Dude, just finished watching Antes del cuerpo, and wow, my brain is kind of fried. It's got me thinking about life, but in that way where you're like, What just happened? It's one of those movies where you're like, Oh, this is gonna be deep, and then BAM, existential crisis, lol.

It's crazy how it messes with your head. Like, there’s this scene where you start questioning if what's real is even real anymore and I'm like, is my life a lie? Seriously, it’s the kind of thing you watch the movie thinking it will chill you out, but nah, it leaves you spiraling, you get me? And the visuals, man, trippy as heck. I didn’t even plan to download the movie at first, just kinda happened, and here I am, mind blown.

>You know when a film does that thing where you're simultaneously bored and captivated? It's weird. The pacing was kinda slow, but that made it even more intense somehow? I dunno, I guess that's art or whatever. Like, it hits you differently and now here I am at 2 AM reevaluating all my life choices. 

And let's talk about the freaking soundtrack! At some point, it was like the music was from another universe or something, just pulling me into this weird vibe. Perfect for the plot, but also made me wanna take a nap, if that makes any sense?

I guess I'll need to watch the movie again at some point to really get it. Feels like those layers you peel away when you’ve had more caffeine than sleep. Man, my life's probably in 2D at this rate, lol. Anyway, let me know what you think if you check it out. Or maybe I’ll tell you not to, could save you from a sleepless night, haha.

int confusionLevel = existentialCrisis + mindBlown();

Dude, I need to crash and attempt to make sense of all this tomorrow. Catch you later!
